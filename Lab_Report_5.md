# Lab Report 5

In Lab this week, we searched for and corrected different errors in student's code so that they would produce the correct results. There were 4 errors and each one had their own error, such as a command typed in the terminal incorrectly and even commands not being properly typed.
In this Lab report, we are supposed to go back to a previous lab and do it differntly than done in the past after learning all the different commands.

## Lab Report 4

In Lab Report 4, we reproduced the tasks from the skill demonstration and thoroughly explained each step. We're able to do the task with a bash script.
